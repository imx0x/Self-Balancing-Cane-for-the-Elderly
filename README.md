# Self-Balancing Cane for the Elderly
* Developed a self-balancing cane using an inverted pendulum mechanism, incorporating a ball as the base for balance and stability.
* Integrated gyroscopes, accelerometers, and advanced features for real-time stabilization and enhanced functionality.
* Included innovative features such as a remote monitoring camera for enhanced safety, an SOS button for instant emergency alerts, and a built-in flashlight for improved visibility in low-light conditions.
* Awarded first place at the state-level VTU competition for innovation and design excellence.

## MOTIVATION

------------

- Aging Population, healthcare challenges üë®‚Äçü¶Ø‚Äç‚û°Ô∏è
- Falls: a global issue requirement assistive devicesü§ï
- Self-balancing mobility aids boost independence üí™

## PROBLEM STATEMENT


------------
### ```To design a self balancing assistive mechanism using the control dynamics of Inverted pendulum that effectively supports users during transitions from sitting to standing posture. By proactively maintaining balance, this system seeks to reduce the risk of falls, enhancing user safety and independence.```


## OBJECTIVES


------------

1. To fine-tune the balancing capability of the designed prototype based on the results and feedback obtained from the Uni-wheel System.
2. To develop a system that can traverse multi-directionally with improved stability.
3. Develop a mechanism to enhance weight-bearing capacity and facilitate transitioning between sitting and standing posture.
